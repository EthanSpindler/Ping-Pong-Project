HOW TO PLAY:

    -   Classic Pong
    -   Two Players Game
    -   When both players are ready, press "Start Game" in the center
    -   Press the Up 'n Down Arrows to move your character
    -   First to 10 wins
    -   On game over, press button to play again

NOTES:

    -   If game says "Refresh and Try Again" on "Start Game"
            Then that means to refresh page as you are not connected to the server
    -   If game bugs out (and it can) then have both players close the page and reopen
